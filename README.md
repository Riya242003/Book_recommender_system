# Book Recommendation System
This project leverages machine learning to recommend books based on user preferences using the Cosine Similarity algorithm. The system utilizes a dataset containing book information and provides recommendations based on similarity scores.

🚀 Features--
User-friendly: Input a book title, and the system recommends similar books. 
Efficient recommendations: Uses Cosine Similarity for finding similar books. 
Rich dataset: Includes a diverse range of books with metadata. 

🛠️ Technologies Used--
Python: Programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Mathematical computations.
Scikit-learn: Cosine Similarity computation.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (optional): Frontend for web-based UI.

📚 Dataset--
The dataset contains the following columns:

Book Title: Name of the book.
Author: Author of the book.
Genre: Genre of the book.
Description: Summary or description.
Ratings: User ratings for the book.

🔄 How It Works--
The dataset is preprocessed to create a vectorized representation of book features.
Cosine Similarity is applied to compute similarity scores between books.
Based on the input book, the system finds and returns the top N most similar books.

📈 Future Enhancements--
Add user profiles for personalized recommendations.
Integrate advanced algorithms like Collaborative Filtering.
Deploy the system on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
